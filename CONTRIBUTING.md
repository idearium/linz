# Contributing to Linz

Linz has a [complete development environment contained within another GitHub repository](https://github.com/linzjs/linz-development).

We do this so that the Linz code can be kept as light as possible.

The development environment contains all dependencies for test frameworks, documentation preview servers, etc.

You can read more [here](https://github.com/linzjs/linz-development) and [here](https://linzjs.readthedocs.io/).
