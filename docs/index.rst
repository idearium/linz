Linz.js
=======

Linz is a framework for creating administration interfaces. Linz is not a CMS, but is capable of CMS like functionality. Linz is a good choice of framework when the administration interface itself *is* the website itself.

Linz is built on Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

Linz is quite new and under rapid development. It is used quite successfully in a number of production sites however. This documentation is the first effort in making this open source project accessible to more developers.
